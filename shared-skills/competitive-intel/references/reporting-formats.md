2. **Link to sources** — Every claim should reference the social post or data point
3. **Actionable endings** — Every section ends with recommended actions
4. **Visual where possible** — Tables > paragraphs for comparisons
5. **Time-bound** — Always specify the date range of the analysis
6. **Trend over snapshot** — Show direction of change, not just current state
