# Competitive Analysis Frameworks

## 1. Competitive Positioning Map

### Purpose
Visualize where competitors stand relative to each other and to you based on social data signals.

### Dimensions to Map

**Dimension pairs (choose based on context):**
- Market presence (share of voice) vs. Sentiment (how people feel)
- Content volume vs. Content quality (engagement rate)
- Brand awareness (mention volume) vs. Brand preference (positive mentions)
- Innovation perception vs. Reliability perception
- Price perception vs. Quality perception

### Data Collection
For each competitor, gather from social data:
- Total mention volume (last 30 days)
- Sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative %)
- Average engagement per post
- Topic diversity (number of distinct topics covered)
- Platform presence (number of active platforms)
- Influencer endorsements/mentions
- Community size signals (follower counts, subreddit sizes)

### Output Format
```
## Competitive Positioning Map

Axis X: [Dimension 1]
Axis Y: [Dimension 2]

| Company | X Score | Y Score | Position |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| You     | [score] | [score] | [quadrant] |
| Comp A  | [score] | [score] | [quadrant] |
| Comp B  | [score] | [score] | [quadrant] |

Quadrants:
- Top-right: [Leaders — high on both dimensions]
- Top-left: [Challengers — high on Y, low on X]
- Bottom-right: [Niche players — high on X, low on Y]
- Bottom-left: [Laggards — low on both]
```

## 2. Competitive Content Strategy Matrix

### Purpose
Compare how competitors approach content across platforms.

### Analysis Structure

For each competitor, analyze:

**Content pillars:**
- What are the 3-5 main topics they consistently cover?
- How does their topic mix compare to audience interest?

**Content format mix:**
- Short-form posts vs. long-form content
- Visual vs. text-heavy
- Educational vs. promotional vs. thought leadership
- Original content vs. curation vs. repurposing

**Platform strategy:**
- Primary platform (where they invest most)
- Secondary platforms (presence but less investment)
- Absent platforms (where they're not competing)

**Posting cadence:**
- Posts per day/week on each platform
- Consistency (regular schedule vs. sporadic)
- Peak activity times

**Engagement quality:**
- Average likes/reactions per post
- Average comments per post
- Comment quality (meaningful vs. surface-level)
- Share/repost ratio

### Output Format
```
## Content Strategy Comparison

| Dimension | Competitor A | Competitor B | You | Opportunity |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| Primary platform | LinkedIn | X | X | LinkedIn gap |
| Posting frequency | 5x/week | Daily | 3x/week | Increase volume |
| Top topic | AI trends | Product updates | Tutorials | AI trends gap |
| Best format | Carousels | Threads | Short posts | Try carousels |
| Avg engagement | 150 | 85 | 120 | — |
| Voice/tone | Authoritative | Casual | Educational | — |
```

## 3. SWOT from Social Data

### Purpose
Build a SWOT analysis grounded in real social signals rather than assumptions.

### Method

**Strengths (from positive social signals):**
- What do people praise about each competitor?
- What features/products get recommended?
- What are they known for in conversations?

**Weaknesses (from negative social signals):**
- What do people complain about?
- What negative patterns appear in reviews/discussions?
- Where do competitors get compared unfavorably?

**Opportunities (from gap analysis):**
- Topics with high demand but low competitor coverage
- Platforms where competitors are absent
- User needs that competitors aren't addressing
- Emerging trends competitors haven't picked up on

**Threats (from competitive movement signals):**
- New features or products competitors are launching
- Competitor hiring patterns (job posts = strategic direction)
- Growing positive sentiment for competitors
- Competitor entering your strongest areas

### Output Format
```
## Competitive SWOT: [Competitor Name]

### Strengths (Social Evidence)
- [Strength]: "[supporting social post/data]"
- [Strength]: "[supporting social post/data]"

### Weaknesses (Social Evidence)
- [Weakness]: "[supporting social post/data]"
- [Weakness]: "[supporting social post/data]"

### Opportunities (For You)
- [Opportunity]: Based on [social data gap]
- [Opportunity]: Based on [competitor absence]

### Threats (Watch Out)
- [Threat]: Signal from [social data]
- [Threat]: Signal from [social data]
```

## 4. Share of Voice Analysis

### Purpose
Quantify how much of the conversation each player owns.

### Method

1. **Define the conversation:** Choose keywords that represent the market/category
2. **Count mentions:** Total posts mentioning each competitor (same time period)
3. **Calculate share:** Each competitor's mentions / total mentions * 100
4. **Track over time:** Compare week-over-week or month-over-month

### Advanced Share of Voice

**Weighted share of voice** — not all mentions are equal:
- Mentions from influencers (>10K followers) = 3x weight
- Mentions with high engagement (>100 interactions) = 2x weight
- Standard mentions = 1x weight

**Share of voice by topic:**
- Break down share of voice by key topic areas
- Shows where each competitor dominates the conversation

**Share of voice by platform:**
- Shows which platforms each competitor owns
- Identifies platform-specific dominance

## 5. Competitive Battle Card Template

### Purpose
Create actionable competitive intelligence cards for sales teams.

### Template

```
## Battle Card: [Competitor Name]

### Quick Facts
- Company: [name]
- Founded: [year]
- Size: [employees, if known]
- Primary platforms: [where they're most active]

### Their Pitch (from social content)
"[How they describe themselves, from their own posts]"

### How Customers Describe Them
"[Actual social posts from users]"

### Strengths (from social evidence)
1. [Strength] — Evidence: [social data]
2. [Strength] — Evidence: [social data]

### Weaknesses (from social evidence)
1. [Weakness] — Evidence: [social data]
2. [Weakness] — Evidence: [social data]

### Common Objections They Raise About Us
- "[Objection]" → Counter: [response]

### Our Advantages Over Them
1. [Advantage] — Proof: [social data or feature comparison]
2. [Advantage] — Proof: [social data or feature comparison]

### When We Lose to Them
- Scenario: [when they win and why]
- Counter-strategy: [how to prevent this]

### When We Win Against Them
- Scenario: [when we win and why]
- Amplify: [how to create this scenario more often]

### Recent Competitive Intel
- [Date]: [notable competitor activity from social]
- [Date]: [notable competitor activity from social]
```

## 6. Competitive Narrative Analysis

### Purpose
Understand the story each competitor tells and how it evolves.

### Dimensions

**Core narrative:** What's the main story they tell about themselves?
**Hero:** Who is the hero in their narrative? (customer, product, company)
**Villain:** What problem or enemy do they position against?
**Transformation:** What change do they promise?
**Proof points:** What evidence do they cite?

### Tracking Narrative Shifts
- When competitors change their messaging, it signals strategic shifts
- Track key phrases and themes over time
- Note when new topics appear or old topics disappear
- Compare stated narrative vs. customer-echoed narrative
