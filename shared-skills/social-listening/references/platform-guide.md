## Platform-Specific Intelligence

### X (Twitter)

**Data signals available:**
- Post content and media
- Engagement metrics (likes, reposts, replies, bookmarks)
- Author profile and follower count
- Hashtags and mentions
- Thread structure

**Best for:**
- Real-time monitoring (things break on Twitter first)
- Industry pulse checks
- Competitor content tracking
- Influencer identification
- News and announcement monitoring

**Analysis tips:**
- High impressions with low engagement = reach without resonance
- Reply ratio matters — high replies can mean controversy or genuine engagement
- Quote tweets often indicate strong opinions (positive or negative)
- Thread performance shows appetite for deeper content
- Time of day significantly impacts visibility

**Common noise filters:**
- Bot activity (repetitive, template-like posts)

- Automated reposts

### Reddit

**Data signals available:**

**Best for:**
- Honest product reviews and comparisons
- User pain points and feature requests

- Technical discussions and support threads
- Buying advice threads

**Analysis tips:**
- Subreddit context is critical — same keyword means different things in different subs
- Comment quality often matters more than post quality
- Upvote ratio reveals controversy
- "What do you use for [X]?" threads are gold for competitive intel
- Sort by controversial for hidden pain points

**High-value subreddit patterns:**

## Cross-Platform Analysis

### Triangulation Pattern
When a topic appears across multiple platforms, it's a strong signal:
- **3+ platforms** = established trend, likely mainstream
- **2 platforms** = emerging trend, worth watching
- **1 platform only** = platform-specific, may not translate

### Platform Velocity
Track how topics move between platforms:
- Often starts on X → moves to Reddit → gets YouTube coverage → LinkedIn commentary
- GitHub/HN → X → mainstream adoption for tech topics
- LinkedIn → industry press → broader conversation for B2B topics

### Sentiment Comparison
Same brand/topic gets different sentiment on different platforms:
- Reddit: Most honest, often more critical
- LinkedIn: Most professional, tends positive (but surface-level)
- X: Most polarized, extreme opinions amplified
- YouTube: Most detailed, balanced reviews
- Podcasts: Most nuanced, longest-form analysis
