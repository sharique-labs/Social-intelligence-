# Analysis Frameworks for Social Intelligence

## 1. Content Gap Analysis

### Purpose
Identify topics, formats, and platforms where your brand or content is underrepresented relative to audience interest and competitor activity.

### Framework

**Step 1: Map the conversation landscape**
- What topics are being discussed in your space? (from search results)
- How much conversation volume exists for each topic?
- Who is driving these conversations?

**Step 2: Map competitor coverage**
- Which of these topics are competitors actively covering?
- What formats are they using? (posts, threads, videos, articles)
- What's their engagement on each topic?

**Step 3: Map your coverage**
- Which of these topics have YOU covered?
- What formats have you used?
- What's your engagement on each topic?

**Step 4: Identify gaps**
```
| Topic | Market Interest | Competitor Coverage | Your Coverage | Gap Type |
|-------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|---------|
| [Topic A] | High | High | None | Competitive gap — catch up |
| [Topic B] | High | Low | None | Blue ocean — first-mover opportunity |
| [Topic C] | Medium | None | None | Emerging — get ahead |
| [Topic D] | High | High | High | Saturated — differentiate or skip |
```

**Gap Types:**
- **Competitive gap:** High demand, competitors present, you're absent → must address
- **Blue ocean:** High demand, nobody covering it well → first-mover advantage
- **Emerging gap:** Growing interest, nobody there yet → get ahead of the curve
- **Format gap:** Topic covered, but not in the format audience prefers
- **Platform gap:** Topic covered on some platforms but not others

### Output
Prioritized list of content opportunities with:
- Topic/keyword
- Recommended format
- Recommended platform
- Urgency level (now / this week / this month)
- Expected impact (based on conversation volume)

## 2. Sentiment Analysis Framework

### Purpose
Understand how people feel about a brand, product, topic, or competitor based on social data.

### Classification

**Positive signals:**
- Praise, recommendations, endorsements
- "Love", "great", "recommend", "best", "amazing"
- Sharing with positive commentary
- Repeat mentions (brand advocates)

**Negative signals:**
- Complaints, frustration, criticism
- "Hate", "terrible", "worst", "switching from", "avoid"
- Support requests with negative tone
- Comparison posts favoring competitors

**Neutral signals:**
- Informational mentions
- News/announcement sharing without opinion
- Questions about the brand/product
- Tagging without commentary

### Sentiment Scoring

For each post, classify as:
- **Strong positive** (+2): Active recommendation, advocacy
- **Positive** (+1): General praise, satisfaction
- **Neutral** (0): Mention without sentiment
- **Negative** (-1): Complaint, disappointment
- **Strong negative** (-2): Active warning, advocacy against

### Aggregate Metrics
- **Sentiment score:** Average across all posts (-2 to +2)
- **Sentiment distribution:** % positive / neutral / negative
- **Sentiment trend:** Direction over time (improving, declining, stable)
- **Sentiment velocity:** Rate of change in sentiment

### Driver Analysis
Identify WHAT drives sentiment:
- **Positive drivers:** Features, support, pricing, content, community
- **Negative drivers:** Bugs, pricing, missing features, support issues, competition

## 3. Trend Detection Framework

### Purpose
Identify emerging topics, declining topics, and cyclical patterns in social conversations.

### Method

**Step 1: Volume tracking**
- How many posts mention this topic per day/week?
- Is volume increasing, decreasing, or stable?

**Step 2: Velocity measurement**
- How fast is conversation growing?
- Exponential growth = viral/trending
- Linear growth = sustained interest
- Spike + decline = news event

**Step 3: Source analysis**
- Who's starting these conversations?
- Influencers → top-down trend
- Community → grassroots trend
- News outlets → event-driven trend

**Step 4: Cross-platform propagation**
- Is the topic spreading across platforms?
- Single platform = niche
- Multi-platform = mainstream trend

### Trend Classification
- **Emerging:** Low volume but growing fast — get in early
- **Growing:** Medium volume, steady increase — invest now
- **Peak:** High volume, growth slowing — don't be late
- **Declining:** Volume decreasing — move on or find fresh angle
- **Cyclical:** Regular patterns (seasonal, event-driven) — plan ahead

## 4. Competitive Analysis Framework

### Purpose
Understand competitor positioning, strengths, weaknesses, and strategy from social data.

### Analysis Dimensions

**Content Strategy Analysis:**
```
| Dimension | Competitor A | Competitor B | You |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Posting frequency | X/week | X/week | X/week |
| Primary platform | [platform] | [platform] | [platform] |
| Top content format | [format] | [format] | [format] |
| Avg engagement rate | X% | X% | X% |
| Key topics | [topics] | [topics] | [topics] |
| Content voice | [tone] | [tone] | [tone] |
```

**Positioning Analysis:**
- What claims do they make?
- What's their core message?
- How do they differentiate?
- What do they NOT talk about?

**Audience Overlap:**
- Who engages with both you and competitors?
- Who engages with competitors but not you? (acquisition opportunity)
- Who engages with you but not competitors? (defend this audience)

**Response Analysis:**
- How do competitors respond to criticism?
- How do they engage with their community?
- What's their response time and tone?

## 5. Ad Opportunity Analysis

### Purpose
Identify where paid amplification could be most effective based on organic social signals.

### Framework

**Step 1: Identify high-demand, low-supply topics**
- Topics with high search/discussion volume
- Low organic coverage from competitors
- Your content addresses these topics

**Step 2: Identify platform-specific opportunities**
- Platforms where the conversation is active but you're not visible
- Platforms where competitor organic reach is limited

**Step 3: Identify audience-specific opportunities**
- Audience segments engaging with competitors but not you
- Audience segments asking questions your product answers

**Step 4: Prioritize by intent**
- Bottom-funnel signals: "looking for", "recommend", "best [category]"
- Mid-funnel: Comparison queries, feature discussions
- Top-funnel: Industry education, problem awareness

### Output
```
Ad Opportunity Recommendations:
1. [Platform] — [Topic] — [Audience] — [Estimated impact]
2. [Platform] — [Topic] — [Audience] — [Estimated impact]
```
