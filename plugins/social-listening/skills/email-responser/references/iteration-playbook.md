# Content Iteration Playbook

## The Performance Loop

Every piece of content is an experiment. This playbook helps you learn from performance data and continuously improve.

```
CREATE → PUBLISH → MEASURE → ANALYZE → LEARN → ITERATE → CREATE
```

## Iteration Decision Framework

### Step 1: Categorize Performance

After analyzing post performance, categorize each post:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Winner** | Top 20% engagement, positive sentiment | Double down — create more like this |
| **Grower** | Average engagement, growing trend | Iterate — improve and try again |
| **Sleeper** | Low engagement, high bookmarks/saves | Reformat — content is good, delivery needs work |
| **Miss** | Below average across all metrics | Learn — extract lesson, move on |
| **Controversial** | High engagement, mixed sentiment | Assess — is this productive controversy? |

### Step 2: Extract the Signal

For each category, identify WHY it performed that way:

**Winners — What made it work?**
- Topic resonance: Did you hit a nerve?
- Timing: Was it posted at the right moment?
- Format: Did the format match the content?
- Hook: Did the opening grab attention?
- Value: Did it deliver genuine insight/utility?
- Social proof: Did influential people engage?

**Misses — What went wrong?**
- Topic mismatch: Did the audience care about this?
- Timing: Was there competing noise?
- Format: Did the format suit the platform?
- Hook: Was the opening compelling enough?
- Depth: Was it too shallow or too deep?
- Competition: Did someone else say it better/first?

### Step 3: Apply Iteration Patterns

## Iteration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Topic Iteration

**When the topic works but could go deeper:**
- Take a successful post's topic and create a series
- Go deeper: surface-level hit → detailed breakdown → step-by-step guide
- Go broader: specific case → general principle → industry trend
- Go personal: industry insight → your experience → lessons learned

**Template:**
```
Original post: [Topic X] got [Y engagement]

Iteration options:
1. "[Topic X]: The Complete Guide" — deeper dive
2. "[Topic X] vs [Related Topic]" — comparison angle
3. "What I Learned from [Topic X]" — personal angle
4. "[Topic X] for [Specific Audience]" — niche version
5. "The [Topic X] Mistake Most People Make" — contrarian angle
```

### Pattern 2: Format Iteration

**When the content is good but the format isn't optimal:**

| Original Format | Low Engagement? Try | Why |
|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Long text post | Thread or carousel | Easier to consume |
| Thread | Single punchy post | More shareable |
| Text only | Add visual/image | Pattern interrupt in feed |
| Video | Short clip + text summary | Lower barrier to engage |
| Article/link | Native post with key points | Platforms penalize outbound links |

### Pattern 3: Hook Iteration

**When the post has value but people aren't stopping to read:**

Rewrite the opening line using these proven patterns:

1. **Contrarian:** "Most people think [X]. They're wrong."
2. **Data-driven:** "[Specific number] — that's how many [surprising stat]."
3. **Story:** "Last week, something happened that changed how I think about [topic]."
4. **Question:** "What would you do if [scenario]?"
5. **List tease:** "3 things I wish I knew about [topic] before [action]."
6. **Authority:** "After [X years/projects/customers], here's what actually works."
7. **FOMO:** "The best [role/teams] are already doing this. Are you?"

### Pattern 4: Timing Iteration

**When content quality is good but reach is low:**

- Test different days of the week
- Test different times of day
- Avoid posting during major events or holidays
- Consider time zones of target audience
- Look at when your best-performing posts were published

**General timing guidelines:**
| Platform | Best Days | Best Times (EST) |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| X | Tue-Thu | 8-10 AM, 12-1 PM |
| LinkedIn | Tue-Wed | 7-9 AM, 12 PM |
| Reddit | Mon-Wed | 6-8 AM (before work crowd) |
| YouTube | Thu-Sat | 12-3 PM |

### Pattern 5: Platform Iteration

**When content works on one platform but not another:**

- Adapt format to platform norms (don't copy-paste across platforms)
- Adjust length (X: short, LinkedIn: medium, Reddit: varies by sub)
- Adjust tone (LinkedIn: professional, Reddit: casual, X: punchy)
- Use platform-specific features (X: threads, LinkedIn: carousels, Reddit: AMAs)

### Pattern 6: Audience Iteration

**When engagement is there but from the wrong audience:**

- Sharpen the target: add industry-specific language
- Adjust examples to match desired audience
- Use platform targeting if available
- Engage in communities where your target audience lives
- Tag or reference thought leaders your audience follows

- Date: [date]
- Performance: [key metrics]
- Improvement: [↑/↓ vs original, by how much]
- Key learning: [what we learned]

### Iteration 2
- What changed: [what was adjusted]
- Date: [date]
- Performance: [key metrics]
- Improvement: [↑/↓ vs previous, by how much]
- Key learning: [what we learned]

### Conclusion

- Key success factor: [what made the difference]
- Apply to future content: [generalizable lesson]
```

## Weekly Iteration Workflow

**Monday: Review**
- Pull last week's post performance data
- Categorize each post (Winner/Grower/Sleeper/Miss)
- Identify top 2 posts to iterate on

**Tuesday-Wednesday: Create iterations**
- Apply relevant iteration pattern to selected posts
- Draft new versions

**Thursday-Friday: Publish and test**
- Publish iterations
- Begin monitoring performance

**Following Monday: Compare**
- Compare iteration performance to originals
- Update iteration log
- Extract lessons for next cycle

## Content Retirement Rules

Not everything is worth iterating on. Retire content when:
- Topic has been covered 3+ times with declining returns
- Market has moved on from the topic
- Competitor has definitively owned the topic
- Audience feedback indicates fatigue with the subject
- The topic no longer aligns with your positioning

## Scaling What Works

When you find a winning formula:

1. **Extract the template:** What pattern made it work?
2. **Apply to new topics:** Same format/structure, different subject
3. **Cross-platform:** Adapt for other platforms
4. **Series creation:** Turn one-off hit into recurring series
5. **Repurpose:** Turn into other formats (post → video → newsletter → guide)
6. **Team enablement:** Document the formula so others can use it
