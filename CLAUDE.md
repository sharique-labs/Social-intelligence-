# Social Intelligence Plugin — Trigify-Powered

## Overview

This plugin gives AI agents access to the entire social web through Trigify's MCP server. It provides social listening, competitive intelligence, and brand monitoring capabilities across X, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Podcasts, and more.

## Architecture

Follows the official Claude Code plugin architecture. Single plugin (`social-listening`) with all skills bundled together.

### Source (edit these)

- `shared-skills/` — Single source of truth for all skill definitions (`SKILL.md` + `references/`)
- `.claude-plugin/skills-map.json` — Maps skills to the plugin + MCP server config
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Marketplace catalog with plugin metadata, categories, tags, and `mcpServers`
- `commands/` — Entry point command files (slash commands)
- `.mcp.json` — Root MCP server config (Trigify)

### Generated (do not edit directly)

- `plugins/` — Generated by `sync-skills.sh`
- `dist/` — Build artifacts from `build-zips.sh`

### Generated Plugin Structure

```
plugins/social-listening/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json      ← Clean manifest (name, version, description, author, keywords, license)
├── .mcp.json             ← Separate MCP server configuration (Trigify)
├── skills/
│   ├── social-listening/
│   │   ├── SKILL.md      ← Auto-discovered by Claude Code
│   │   └── references/
│   ├── competitive-intel/
│   │   ├── SKILL.md
│   │   └── references/
│   └── brand-monitor/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── references/
└── commands/
    └── social-intelligence.md
```

Key points:
- `plugin.json` is a clean manifest — no `mcpServers` or `skills` metadata (these are handled by `.mcp.json` and auto-discovery)
- `.mcp.json` lives at the plugin root as a separate file per the official spec
- Skills are auto-discovered from `skills/*/SKILL.md` — no need to declare them in the manifest

## Skills

### social-listening
Core skill for creating social listening searches, fetching posts, and analyzing results across platforms. Supports keyword monitoring, competitor tracking, brand mentions, and industry trend detection.

## MCP Server
