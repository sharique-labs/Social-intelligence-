# Social Intelligence Plugin — Trigify-Powered

## Overview

This plugin gives AI agents access to the entire social web through Trigify's MCP server. It provides social listening, competitive intelligence, and brand monitoring capabilities across X, Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Podcasts, and more.

## Architecture

Follows the official Claude Code plugin architecture.

### Source (edit these)

- `shared-skills/` — Single source of truth for all skill definitions (`SKILL.md` + `references/`)
- `.claude-plugin/skills-map.json` — Maps which skills go to which departments + MCP server config
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Marketplace catalog with plugin metadata, categories, tags, and `mcpServers`
- `commands/` — Department entry point command files (slash commands)
- `.mcp.json` — Root MCP server config (Trigify)

### Generated (do not edit directly)

- `plugins/` — Generated by `sync-skills.sh`, one plugin per department
- `dist/` — Build artifacts from `build-zips.sh`

### Generated Plugin Structure (per department)

Each department plugin follows the official layout:

```
plugins/{department}/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json      ← Clean manifest (name, version, description, author, keywords, license)
├── .mcp.json             ← Separate MCP server configuration (Trigify)
├── skills/
│   └── {skill-name}/
│       ├── SKILL.md      ← Auto-discovered by Claude Code
│       └── references/   ← Supporting docs for the skill
└── commands/
    └── social-intelligence.md
```

Key points:
- `plugin.json` is a clean manifest — no `mcpServers` or `skills` metadata (these are handled by `.mcp.json` and auto-discovery)
- `.mcp.json` lives at the plugin root as a separate file per the official spec
- Skills are auto-discovered from `skills/*/SKILL.md` — no need to declare them in the manifest

## Skills
